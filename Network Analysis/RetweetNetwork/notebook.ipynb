Fortunately, Twitter makes much of its data freely available, which you can read about in its [developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs). This template queries retweet data and then plots it in an interactive visualization to understand conversations around a hashtag of your choice.\n\nTo be able to use this template, the following criteria must be satisfied:\n- You will need an active Twitter account.\n- You will need a bearer token for accessing the Twitter API. \n\nTo get a bearer token, you will need to navigate to this [page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info) and sign up for Essential access. This will take you through a short verification process. When you are finished, you should be able to create a new app and generate a bearer token which will be used to access the API.\n\n_Warning: This template will extract real Twitter data. As a result, some content may contain offensive language._","metadata":{},"id":"e9c78c83-1aec-4d06-b80b-2ab703343c27","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 1. Getting Set Up\nIn order to access the Twitter API, you will need to use an integration to set an environment variable. To add a new environment variable in your Workspace, click on the environment tab in the far left toolbar of the Workspace editing interface. Next, click the \"+\" next to \"Environment variables\". You will need to specify the name (BEARER_TOKEN) and the value (the token you were provided). You can call this \"Twitter Integration\". You can read more about environment variables [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/work/environment-variables). Click \"Create\" and follow the remaining steps, and you should be ready to go!\n\nThe code then performs the following:\n1. Installs and imports the packages you will use to retrieve Twitter data and visualize it. \n2. Sets your bearer token for accessing the Twitter API. This does not require further input if you have configured your BEARER_TOKEN environment variable correctly.\n3. Sets the hashtags you want to compare. By default, this template analyzes a retweet network based on the hashtag \"#python\". You are free to supply any hashtag you wish to use (a topic preceded by a `#` symbol).\n4.

The extracted tweets and relevant information are returned as a DataFrame containing an 'edge list', or a list of all edges between nodes.

In the case of retweets, centrality will indicate that a user is getting a large number of retweets.\n- **Out-degree centrality** represents the number of edges going out of a node. In the case of retweets, centrality will indicate that a user is retweeting a lot.\n- **Betweeness centrality**  represents the number of 'shortest paths' between nodes that pass through through a specific node. In the case of tweets, it measures the extent to which a user connects other communities of users.\n\nThe code also stores the number of in_degrees (tweets) and out_degrees (retweets) to visualize later with Plotly.","metadata":{},"id":"ee5bb14e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Create a directed network graph from the DataFrame\nG = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, \"retweeter\", \"tweeter\", create_using=nx.DiGraph())\n\n# Calculate the in-degree centrality for retweets\nin_centrality = nx.in_degree_centrality(G)\n\n# Caluculate the total number of tweets for later plotting purposes\nin_degrees = dict(G.in_degree())\n\n# Store centralities in DataFrame\npopular_tweeters = pd.DataFrame(\n    list(in_centrality.items()), columns=[\"username\", \"in-degree_centrality\"]\n)\n\n# Print the most important users by their centrality\npopular_tweeters.sort_values(\"in-degree_centrality\", ascending=False).head()","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"id":"b758b6c1","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Calculate the out-degree centrality for retweets\nout_centrality = nx.out_degree_centrality(G)\n\n# Caluculate the total number of retweets for later plotting purposes\nout_degrees = dict(G.out_degree())\n\n# Store centralities in DataFrame\nactive_retweeters = pd.DataFrame(\n    list(out_centrality.items()), columns=[\"username\", \"out-degree_centrality\"]\n)\n\n# Print the most important users by the amount they retweet\nactive_retweeters.sort_values(\"out-degree_centrality\", ascending=False).head()","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"id":"c429976c","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Create an undirected network graph from the DataFrame\nG = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, \"retweeter\", \"tweeter\")\n\n# Calculate the betweenness centrality for retweets\nbetweetnness = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)\n\n# Store centralities in DataFrame\nbridging_users = pd.DataFrame(\n    list(betweetnness.items()), columns=[\"username\", \"betweenness\"]\n)\n\n# Print the most important users by how much they bridge other users\nbridging_users.sort_values(\"betweenness\", ascending=False).head()","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"id":"db0d0dae","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Try to compare this list of users with high betweeness with the list those with a high in-degree centrality.
