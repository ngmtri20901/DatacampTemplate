{"cells":[{"source":"# Amazon S3 Bucket Connection\nThis recipe shows you how to connect to AWS S3 bucket. Using the environment tab, you can make this connection without exposing sensitive data; you can learn more about environment variables [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/work/environment-variables).\n\nAs an example, you can connect your workspace to a fictional online ticket sale dataset. The files for this dataset are stored in a S3 bucket that is hosted on a DataCamp server. The ER diagram of this sample database is shown in the appendix of this recipe. The right set of environment variables to connect to this sample database can be found in [this section](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/integrations/s3-bucket#sample-database-online-ticket-sales) of the documentation.\n\nOnce you are familiar with this example, you can also connect to your own Amazon S3 bucket by inserting your own credentials as the environment variables.","metadata":{},"id":"a8ceadbb-8468-42a1-b09e-5e484bdae44b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import packages\nimport os\nimport io\nimport boto3\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{},"id":"8959720a-1f73-4ad0-ae0b-12be425b3600","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"DIR_NAME = \"workspacedemos3/\"\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3')\n# Load the bucket with specified name.\nbucket = s3.Bucket(os.environ[\"AWS_BUCKET_NAME\"])\n# The data will be loaded into a dictionary of pandas DataFrames\ndfs = {}\n# Each DataFrame will be accessible with a key (the filename without extension)\nfor bucket_object in bucket.objects.filter(Prefix=DIR_NAME):\n    obj = bucket.Object(key=bucket_object.key)\n    data_string = io.BytesIO(obj.get()['Body'].read())\n    dfs[bucket_object.key[:-4].replace(DIR_NAME, \"\")] = pd.read_csv(data_string, encoding='utf8', sep=\"|\", index_col=0, header=None)","metadata":{},"id":"a1eb3e81-37ed-4365-8a83-93845d1e2e71","cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Print out all available DataFrames.
