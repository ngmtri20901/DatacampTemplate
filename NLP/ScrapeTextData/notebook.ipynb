In other words, your work is completely private unless you decide to publish your workspace. It is currently not possible to share your workspace with other people to collaborate, but you are able to share workspace publications with others (see Publications section for more).Maximum workspace sizeIf the total size of all the files in your workspace exceeds 5GB, you will no longer be able to access your workspace. If you unintentionally ended up in this situation and want to continue, let us know and we'll help you out. To contact us, see Support. Saving your editsAll your edits are automatically saved, so you do not need to worry about hitting that save button every now and then. If you close and re-enter the workspace at a later point in time, all your work from before is saved. Renaming the workspaceYou can change the default workspace name. To rename the workspace, select the default name (as shown), type a new workspace name, and select enter to save.\\u200b\\u200bSwitching the editorYou can edit and execute the source files in several editors.Python WorkspaceR WorkspaceIf you edit or create a new Python workspace, you can edit and execute the source files in DataCamp's notebook editor or JupyterLab.To switch between the editors, select Switch Editor. \\u200b\\u200bIf you edit or create a new R workspace, the workspace files open in a notebook in RStudio, the most popular tool for doing data science or statistical analyses. You cannot switch to another editor.Exiting the workspaceTo exit the workspace, select the  exit icon.
