{"cells":[{"source":"# Machine Learning with Python\nIn this notebook, you will build a machine learning model to predict whether or not a customer cancelled a hotel booking. You will be introduced to the `scikit-learn` framework to do machine learning in Python. \n\nWe will use a dataset on hotel bookings from the article [\"Hotel booking demand datasets\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), published in the Elsevier journal, [Data in Brief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief). The abstract of the article states \n\n> This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. \n\nFor convenience, the two datasets have been combined into a single csv file `data/hotel_bookings.csv`. Let us start by importing all the functions needed to import, visualize and model the data.","metadata":{},"id":"dd84a33e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Data imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Visualization imports\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [8, 4]\n\n\n# ML Imports\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, cross_validate, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score","metadata":{},"id":"6ec75f5d","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## 0.
