You cannot use the train data again for this, since this will give you an overestimate of its performance on new data. However, you can solve this by training the model on a portion of the data (~70%) and evaluate its performance on the rest. These are called the training set and test set respectively. This recipe tells you how you can do this using the scikit-learn's `train_test_split()` function.","metadata":{},"id":"8417ac1e-70f9-4cb9-9615-06969f1dccd2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Load packages\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'","metadata":{},"id":"ad6694a6-f064-44a1-aa77-57095fda33e5","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Upload your data as CSV and load as data frame\ndf = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{},"id":"50265658-3ac1-4075-bc11-46a313ddfa40","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>longitude</th>\n","      <th>latitude</th>\n","      <th>housing_median_age</th>\n","      <th>total_rooms</th>\n","      <th>total_bedrooms</th>\n","      <th>population</th>\n","      <th>households</th>\n","      <th>median_income</th>\n","      <th>median_house_value</th>\n","      <th>ocean_proximity</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>-122.23</td>\n","      <td>37.88</td>\n","      <td>41.0</td>\n","      <td>880.0</td>\n","      <td>129.0</td>\n","      <td>322.0</td>\n","      <td>126.0</td>\n","      <td>8.3252</td>\n","      <td>452600.0</td>\n","      <td>NEAR BAY</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>-122.22</td>\n","      <td>37.86</td>\n","      <td>21.0</td>\n","      <td>7099.0</td>\n","      <td>1106.0</td>\n","      <td>2401.0</td>\n","      <td>1138.0</td>\n","      <td>8.3014</td>\n","      <td>358500.0</td>\n","      <td>NEAR BAY</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>-122.24</td>\n","      <td>37.85</td>\n","      <td>52.0</td>\n","      <td>1467.0</td>\n","      <td>190.0</td>\n","      <td>496.0</td>\n","      <td>177.0</td>\n","      <td>7.2574</td>\n","      <td>352100.0</td>\n","      <td>NEAR BAY</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>-122.25</td>\n","      <td>37.85</td>\n","      <td>52.0</td>\n","      <td>1274.0</td>\n","      <td>235.0</td>\n","      <td>558.0</td>\n","      <td>219.0</td>\n","      <td>5.6431</td>\n","      <td>341300.0</td>\n","      <td>NEAR BAY</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>-122.25</td>\n","      <td>37.85</td>\n","      <td>52.0</td>\n","      <td>1627.0</td>\n","      <td>280.0</td>\n","      <td>565.0</td>\n","      <td>259.0</td>\n","      <td>3.8462</td>\n","      <td>342200.0</td>\n","      <td>NEAR BAY</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   longitude  latitude  housing_median_age  total_rooms  total_bedrooms  \\\n","0    -122.23     37.88                41.0        880.0           129.0   \n","1    -122.22     37.86                21.0       7099.0          1106.0   \n","2    -122.24     37.85                52.0       1467.0           190.0   \n","3    -122.25     37.85                52.0       1274.0           235.0   \n","4    -122.25     37.85                52.0       1627.0           280.0   \n","\n","   population  households  median_income  median_house_value ocean_proximity  \n","0       322.0       126.0         8.3252            452600.0        NEAR BAY  \n","1      2401.0      1138.0         8.3014            358500.0        NEAR BAY  \n","2       496.0       177.0         7.2574            352100.0        NEAR BAY  \n","3       558.0       219.0         5.6431            341300.0        NEAR BAY  \n","4       565.0       259.0         3.8462            342200.0        NEAR BAY  "]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"source":"The dataset (source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices)) consists of information about houses in California.
