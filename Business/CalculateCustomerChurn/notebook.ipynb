Preventing customer churn is critical, and some estimates suggest that acquiring a new customer can be as much as [25 times as costly](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers) as keeping an existing one.\n\nThe first step to reducing churn is understanding the extent to which your customers are churning.
